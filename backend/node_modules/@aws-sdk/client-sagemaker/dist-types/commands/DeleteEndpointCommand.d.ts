 * <p>Deletes an endpoint. SageMaker frees up all of the resources that were deployed when the
 *             endpoint was created. </p>
 *          <p>SageMaker retires any custom KMS key grants associated with the endpoint, meaning you don't
 *             need to use the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_RevokeGrant.html">RevokeGrant</a> API call.</p>
 *          <p>When you delete your endpoint, SageMaker asynchronously deletes associated endpoint
 *             resources such as KMS key grants. You might still see these resources in your account
 *             for a few minutes after deleting your endpoint. Do not delete or revoke the permissions
 *             for your <code>
 *                <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateModel.html#sagemaker-CreateModel-request-ExecutionRoleArn">ExecutionRoleArn</a>
 *             </code>, otherwise SageMaker cannot delete these
 *             resources.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { SageMakerClient, DeleteEndpointCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-sagemaker"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { SageMakerClient, DeleteEndpointCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-sagemaker"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new SageMakerClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteEndpointInput
 *   EndpointName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteEndpointCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteEndpointCommandInput - {@link DeleteEndpointCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteEndpointCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteEndpointCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteEndpointCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link SageMakerClientResolvedConfig | config} for SageMakerClient's `config` shape.
