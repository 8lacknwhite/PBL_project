 * <p>Use this operation to delete a workforce.</p>
 *          <p>If you want to create a new workforce in an Amazon Web Services Region where
 *       a workforce already exists, use this operation to delete the
 *       existing workforce and then use
 *       to create a new workforce.</p>
 *          <important>
 *             <p>If a private workforce contains one or more work teams, you must use
 *             the
 *             operation to delete all work teams before you delete the workforce.
 *             If you try to delete a workforce that contains one or more work teams,
 *             you will recieve a <code>ResourceInUse</code> error.</p>
 *          </important>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { SageMakerClient, DeleteWorkforceCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-sagemaker"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { SageMakerClient, DeleteWorkforceCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-sagemaker"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new SageMakerClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteWorkforceRequest
 *   WorkforceName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteWorkforceCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteWorkforceCommandInput - {@link DeleteWorkforceCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteWorkforceCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteWorkforceCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteWorkforceCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
